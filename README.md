# Road_Damage_Detection
In recent years, deep learning techniques have shown promising results in variou In this research paper, we propose a road damage detection system using a convolutional neural network (CNN). We trained our CNN on a publicly available dataset of road images containing various types of damage, including cracks, potholes, and patches.
